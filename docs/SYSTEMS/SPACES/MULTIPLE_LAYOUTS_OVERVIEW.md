# Multiple Layouts System Documentation

## Introduction

This documentation covers the multiple layouts system, which introduced support for different layout configurations for desktop and mobile, applying the Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle and implementing significant improvements to the mobile experience.

**When to consult:** To understand how the feed works specifically in homebase.

## 🎯 Main Implemented Changes

### Summary of Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**
   - Layout controllers separated from layout presenters
   - Well-defined responsibilities between components
   - Easier maintenance and extensibility

2. **Functional Drag-and-Drop System**
   - Fixed the issue where drag didn't update order
   - Centralized ordering in layout instead of individual
   - Optimized performance with memoization

3. **Immutable Contextual Feed**
   - Feed appears only in homebase (`/homebase`)
   - Automatic creation and management
   - Doesn't interfere with other contexts

4. **Automatic Migration**
   - Old layouts are migrated automatically
   - Total preservation of existing data
   - Transparent process for users

## 🔄 How the System Works

### 1. Detection and Migration

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Space loads] --> B{Layout migrated?}
    B -->|No| C[Execute migration]
    B -->|Yes| D[Use current data]
    C --> E[Preserve old data]
    E --> F[Create new structure]
    F --> G[Save configuration]
    G --> D
    D --> H[Render layout]
```

### 2. Layout Selection

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Determine context] --> B{Is mobile?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Is preview?}
    B -->|No| F[Desktop Layout]
    C -->|Yes| D[Mobile Preview]
    C -->|No| E[Mobile Layout]
    D --> G[Render]
    E --> G
    F --> G
```

### 3. Drag-and-Drop Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User drags] --> B[MobileSettings]
    B --> C[New order calculated]
    C --> D[ThemeSettingsEditor]
    D --> E[Save to layout]
    E --> F[Space re-renders]
    F --> G[New order applied]
```

## 🛠️ For Developers

### Key Points to Watch

1. **Always check migration**
   ```typescript
   // Old layouts may still exist
   const needsMigration = !layoutDetails.layouts;
   ```

2. **Use migrated data**
   ```typescript
   // Always use current configuration after Space.tsx
   const mobileOrder = layoutDetails.layouts.mobile.fidgetOrder;
   ```

3. **Contextual feed**
   ```typescript
   // Feed should only appear in homebase
   const shouldShowFeed = pathname === '/homebase';
   ```

### Code Patterns

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Separation of Concerns
<MobileLayout 
  data={processedData}
  onOrderChange={handleOrderChange}
/>

// ❌ Bad: Layout doing business logic
<MobileLayout 
  fidgetInstanceDatums={raw}
  onSave={rawSave}
/>
```

### Debugging

```typescript
// Useful logs for debug
console.log('Layout state:', {
  migrated: !!layoutDetails.layouts,
  mobileOrder: layoutDetails.layouts?.mobile?.fidgetOrder,
  feedEnabled: pathname === '/homebase'
});
```

## 🔧 Extensibility

### Adding New Layouts

```typescript
interface LayoutFidgetDetails {
  layouts?: {
    mobile: MobileLayout;
    tablet?: TabletLayout;     // Future
    desktop?: DesktopLayout;   // Future
    tv?: TVLayout;            // Future
  };
}
```

### New Feed Types

```typescript
interface FeedSystem {
  homebase: HomebaseFeed;
  community?: CommunityFeed;   // Future
  personal?: PersonalFeed;     // Future
}
```

## 📞 Support

### Common Issues

1. **Drag doesn't work**: Check if migration was executed
2. **Feed doesn't appear**: Confirm you're on `/homebase` path
3. **Order doesn't persist**: Check drag-and-drop callbacks
4. **Performance**: Check for excessive re-renders

- Consult specific documents for technical details
- Use debug logs for troubleshooting
- Check migration states in case of issues
