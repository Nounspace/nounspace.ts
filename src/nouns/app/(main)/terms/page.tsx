          services that link to the Website or Interface, as well as any
          information, text, links, graphics, photos, audio, video or other
          materials stored, retrieved or accessed through or via the Website,
          Interface, or otherwise, are individually and collectively referred to

          The Website provides a means of accessing the Ethereum blockchain
          protocol (the “<b>Protocol</b>”), which is comprised of open-source
          self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on various
          permissionless public blockchains, such as Ethereum. OSV does not
          control or operate any version of the Protocol on any blockchain
          network. The Interface is an independent interface providing one of
          the available applications through which users, via self-custodial
          wallets, interact with the Protocol.

        <h3>II. Services</h3>
        <p>
          The Website is an informational resource about the Protocol; however,
          it is not the exclusive or sole source. All information provided in
          connection with your access and use of the Services is intended for
          informational purposes only. While we strive to provide accurate and
          reliable information, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness,
          or timeliness of the information provided. It is possible that the
          information may be outdated or subject to errors or omissions. The
          codebases of all the versions of the Protocol are not access,
          maintained or otherwise modified in any way by OSV. You should not
          take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information
          contained on the Website, including, without limitation, developer
          information or any other information that we make available at any
          time, including blog posts, data, articles, links to third-party
          content, Discord content, news feeds, tutorials, tweets, and videos.
          You further acknowledge and agree that we will not be responsible or
          liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or
          alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance
          on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any
          such site or resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is very important to understand that neither we nor any affiliated
          entity is a party to any transaction on the blockchain networks
          underlying the Protocol; we do not have possession, custody or control
          over any cryptoassets, or any user&apos;s funds. You understand that
          when you interact with the Protocol, you retain control over your
          cryptoassets at all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          To interact with the Protocol using the Interface, you will need to
          connect and engage with it through your self-custodial wallet.
          It&apos;s essential to understand that your self-custodial wallet is
          provided by a third-party entity and is generally governed by separate
          terms and conditions set by the respective third-party service
          provider. These terms and conditions may involve additional fees,
          disclaimers, or risk warnings regarding the accuracy and reliance on
          the provided information. Reviewing and comprehending the terms and
          conditions associated with your chosen self-custodial wallet provider
          to ensure compliance and to be aware of any applicable charges or
          risks is your sole responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the non-custodial and decentralized nature of the technology,
          we are not intermediaries, agents, advisors, or custodians, and we do
          not have a fiduciary relationship or obligation to you regarding any
          other decisions or activities that you affect when using our Services.
          We have no information about all Protocol transactions beyond what is
          publicly available via the blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that we do not have information regarding all Protocol
          transactions beyond what is available or obtainable publicly via the
          blockchain. However, we may collect information regarding the users of
          the Services in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          There may be associated blockchain fees. Transactions using
          blockchains may require the payment of gas fees, which are essentially
          network transaction fees paid on every transaction that occurs on the
          selected blockchain network. Please note that gas fees are
          non-refundable. We do not provide any services to users or deliver,
          hold, and/or receive payment for cryptoassets.

        <h3>IV. Assumption of Risk</h3>
        <p>
          Technologies such as smart contracts on various blockchains,
          cryptographic tokens generated by the smart contracts, and other
          nascent software, applications, and systems that interact with
          blockchain-based networks are experimental, speculative, inherently
          risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, bugs, malfunctions,
          cyberattacks, or changes to the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks)
          could disrupt these technologies and even result in a total loss of
          cryptoassets, their market value, or digital funds. We assume no
          liability or responsibility for any such risks. If you are not
          comfortable assuming these risks, you should not access or engage in
          transactions using blockchain-based technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not responsible for the content or services of any third-party,
          including, without limitation, any network or apps like Discord or
          MetaMask, and we make no representations regarding the content or
          accuracy of any third-party services or materials. The use and access
          of any third-party products or services, including through the
          Services, are at your own risk. Please note that we do not have
          control over third-party services. Consequently, we cannot guarantee,
          endorse, or recommend such content or services to users of the
          Interface, nor can we endorse their use for any specific purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that all transactions accessed through the
          blockchain-based networks will be automatically processed using one or
          more smart contracts. By engaging in transactions using the Services,
          you acknowledge and consent to the automatic processing of all
          transactions in connection with using the Services. You further
          acknowledge and agree that the applicable smart contract will dictate
          how the funds of a transaction and ownership of cryptoassets are
          distributed.

        <p>
          You acknowledge the risks of using the Services. You bear sole
          responsibility for evaluating the Services before using them, and all
          transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, final, and without
          refunds. The Services may be disabled, disrupted, or adversely
          impacted as a result of sophisticated cyber-attacks, surges in
          activity, computer viruses, and/or other operational or technical
          challenges, among other things. We disclaim any ongoing obligation to
          notify you of all the potential risks of using and accessing our
          Services. You agree to accept these risks and agree that you will not
          seek to hold any OSV Indemnified Party responsible for any consequent
          losses.

          wallet. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for
          maintaining the security of your self-custodial wallet. You alone are
          responsible for securing your private keys. We do not have access to
          your private keys. Any unauthorized access to your self-custodial
          wallet by third parties could result in the loss or theft of any
          cryptoasset or funds held in your account and any associated accounts.
          You understand and agree that we have no involvement in, and you will
          not hold us responsible for managing and maintaining the security of
          your self-custodial wallet. The private key associated with the
          self-custodial wallet address from which you transfer cryptoassets or
          the private key associated is the only private key that can control
          the cryptoassets you transfer into the smart contracts.

          violation of these Terms. If we have a reasonable suspicion that you
          are utilizing the Services for illegal purposes, we reserve the right
          to take whatever action we deem appropriate.

          Negotiations
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to commencing any legal proceeding against us of any kind,
          including an arbitration as set forth below, you and we agree that we
          will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy between us
          arising out of or relating to the agreement or the Services (each, a “
          <b>Dispute</b>” and, collectively, “<b>Disputes</b>”) by engaging in
          good faith negotiations. Such good faith negotiations require, at a
          minimum, that the aggrieved party provide a written notice to the
          other party specifying the nature and details of the Dispute. The
          party receiving such notice shall have thirty (30) days to respond to
          the notice. Within sixty (60) days notice shall have thirty (30) days
          to respond to the notice. Within sixty (60) days after the aggrieved
          party sent the initial notice, the parties shall meet and confer in
          good faith by videoconference, or by telephone, to try to resolve the
          Dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within
          ninety (90) days after the aggrieved party sent the initial notice,
          the parties may agree to mediate their Dispute, or either party may
          submit the Dispute to arbitration as set forth below.
        </p>
        <p>
          You and we agree that any Dispute that cannot be resolved through the
          procedures set forth above will be resolved through binding
          arbitration in accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of
          the International Centre for Dispute Resolution. The place of
          arbitration shall be Miami, Florida. The language of the arbitration
          shall be English. The arbitrator(s) shall have experience adjudicating
          matters involving Internet technology, software applications,
          financial transactions and, ideally, blockchain technology. The
          arbitrator&apos;s award of damages must be consistent with the terms
          of the “Limitation of Liability” subsection of these Terms as to the
          types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The
          prevailing party will be entitled to an award of their reasonable
          attorney&apos;s fees and costs. Except as may be required by law,
          neither a party nor its representatives may disclose the existence,
          content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
          written consent of (all/both) parties.
